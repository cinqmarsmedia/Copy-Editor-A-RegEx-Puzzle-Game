# Copy Editor: A RegEx Puzzle Game

A puzzle game by the educational non-profit [Cinq-Mars Media](https://cinqmarsmedia.com) that encourages learning Regular Expressions. The game is currently available on [steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1489660/Copy_Editor_A_RegEx_Puzzle/) and [itch.io](https://cinqmarsmedia.itch.io/copyeditor).

## Installing

The game uses the Ionic Framework, Angular and Electron as its foundation. 

1) Install Node.js if not already on system.
2) Download the codebase and **cd** into the root directory
3) run **npm ci** or **npm install** to download dependencies
4) Run **npm start** 

The game should then run, however, all firebase credentials have obviously been removed. New ones can be generated and added within **constants.ts**.
